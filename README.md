# Starling Bank Round Up Challenge

### Federico Silveri

Develop a “round-up” feature for Starling customers using Starling's
public developer API that is available to all customers and partners.


For a customer, take all the transactions in a given week and round
them up to the nearest pound.
For example with spending of £4.35, £5.20 and £0.87, the round-up would be £1.58. 

This amount should then be transferred into a savings goal, helping the customer save for future adventures.
